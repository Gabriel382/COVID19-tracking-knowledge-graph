# path = 

## The expiration parameter refers to all data that is automatically downloaded
## from various (mostly) open sources, relative to airports, runways, navaids,
## and so on. Most of these online databases are regularly updated, so it is
## recommended to let the library remember when to expire caches and download
## the data again.
## Files are removed iff new files can be downloaded.
expiration = 90 days

## The purge parameter refers to the cache folder containing data from the
## Opensky Impala shell. Cache files tend to take space so you may want to let
## the library delete older files.
## Files are removed when the library is imported.
purge = 180 days

## input here a list of plugins you wish to activate each time you import
## traffic. The list may be simultaneously multi-line and comma-separated.
